      <ul>
        <li><strong>You tell us what you need.</strong> We’ll ask the right questions to keep it clear and straightforward.</li>
        <li><strong>We build a site that fits your brand.</strong> Clean, modern, and built to reflect what you do best.</li>
        <li><strong>You go live — and we’re here if you need anything.</strong> We don’t disappear once the site is launched.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe websites should serve your business — not the other way around.</p>
