  <h2>Refund Policy</h2>

  <p>We stand behind our work and aim to deliver quality service every time. However, due to the custom nature of web design:</p>

    <li>If you purchase hosting and cancel within <strong>7 days</strong>, a full refund is available. After that, hosting fees are non-refundable.</li>
    <li>If you're unsatisfied with the final result, we offer <strong>1–2 revision rounds</strong> to ensure it meets your expectations.</li>
    <li>Chargebacks without first contacting us will result in revocation of all deliverables and blacklisting from future services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have any concerns, contact us and we'll do our best to resolve the issue.</p>
